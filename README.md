## **Insights Generated**
- **Prevalence of Cyberbullying Types**  
  The dataset reveals a balanced distribution of cyberbullying types. Categories such as religion, age, gender, and ethnicity each comprise around 20% of the total cyberbullying-related tweets.
  
- **Longest Tweets by Cyberbullying Type**  
  Tweets discussing sensitive topics like religion and age tend to be longer. For example, the "religion" category has the highest number of long tweets (7,293 instances), followed by the "age" category (6,226 long tweets). This suggests that these topics often provoke deeper, more complex discussions.

- **Hashtag and Mention Analysis**  
  Tweets containing hashtags were often used to highlight sensitive subjects, while frequent use of `@mentions` indicated that users were targeting individuals directly. This suggests a need for more advanced moderation and reporting tools to handle personal attacks.

- **Keyword Analysis**  
  Key terms such as "bully," "attack," "abuse," "harass," and "troll" were prominently featured in tweets categorized under the "age" cyberbullying type. This highlights a significant need for targeted interventions to address these harmful behaviors online.

## **Recommendations**
- **Targeted Interventions:** Focus on the most prevalent types of cyberbullying (age, gender, and ethnicity) for preventative measures.
- **Hashtag Monitoring:** Track common hashtags associated with cyberbullying to detect trending conversations early.
- **Tag Monitoring:** Track accounts that are frequently mentioned in cyberbullying tweets to identify targeted individuals and provide them with timely 
  support and resources.
